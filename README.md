# Idea-Generator
This notebook sets up an AI-based idea generation tool. It installs necessary libraries like Transformers, Gradio, Torch, and Accelerate, then uses a text-to-text generation model (MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M) to create a Gradio interface for generating creative ideas or text outputs from user prompts.
