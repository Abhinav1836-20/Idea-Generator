# Idea-Generator
This notebook sets up an AI-based idea generation tool. It installs necessary libraries like Transformers, Gradio, Torch, and Accelerate, then uses a text-to-text generation model (MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M) to create a Gradio interface for generating creative ideas or text outputs from user prompts.
It begins by installing the necessary Python libraries such as Transformers, Gradio, Torch, and Accelerate.
he project then imports the required modules and sets up a text-to-text generation pipeline using the MBZUAI/LaMini-Flan-T5-783M model from Hugging Face. This model is lightweight yet capable of understanding user prompts and generating meaningful, creative text outputs. Finally, a Gradio interface is implemented, allowing users to type prompts such as requests for business ideas, slogans, or creative suggestionsâ€”and instantly receive AI-generated responses.
